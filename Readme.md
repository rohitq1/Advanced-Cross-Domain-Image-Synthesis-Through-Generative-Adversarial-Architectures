# Project Title

## Overview
This project leverages TensorFlow to perform tasks related to specific datasets, such as "cityscapes," "edges2handbags," "edges2shoes," "facades," "maps," and "night2day." It explores image-based processing, likely involving tasks such as segmentation, generation, or transformation.

## Features
- Dataset flexibility: Users can select from several pre-defined datasets.
- Visualization: Includes modules for plotting and displaying results.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- matplotlib
- IPython

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/rohitq1/Advanced-Cross-Domain-Image-Synthesis-Through-Generative-Adversarial-Architectures.git)
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Untitled6.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells step-by-step to execute the code.
3. Modify the `dataset_name` parameter to experiment with different datasets.

## Datasets Supported
- **cityscapes**: Urban street scenes.
- **edges2handbags**: Edge-to-handbag translation.
- **edges2shoes**: Edge-to-shoe translation.
- **facades**: Building facade segmentation.
- **maps**: Map generation.
- **night2day**: Night-to-day image translation.

## Acknowledgments
This project builds upon TensorFlow and related visualization tools to provide flexible and customizable image processing workflows.
